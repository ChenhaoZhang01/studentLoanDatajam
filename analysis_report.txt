SAMPLE:
  - Total counties analyzed: 3134
  - High-Speed sample: 2642 counties (CLT: YES)

  - Classification threshold: 100.0% broadband access

RESULTS - MATH SCORES:
  - High-Speed mean: -0.044
  - Low-Speed mean: -0.022
  - Difference: -0.022 points
  - t-statistic: -2.0031
  - p-value: 0.0455
  - Cohen's d: -0.090 (negligible)
